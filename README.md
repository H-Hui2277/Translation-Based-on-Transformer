# Neural-Machine-Translation-Based-on-Transformer
一个基于transformer架构的神经机器翻译框架，大部分代码借鉴于李沐的动手学深度学习，已经完全去除了对d2l的依赖。

A neural machine translation framework based on transformer architecture, with most of the code borrowed from Li Mu's hands-on learning of deep learning, has completely removed its dependence on D2L.
